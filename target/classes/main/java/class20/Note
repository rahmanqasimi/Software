Method overloading:
    1) Can we overload private methods?
    Yes
    2) Can we Overload the static methods?
    Yes
    3) Can we overload the main method?
    Yes
    4) Can we overload a method by changing its return type?
===============================================================
Create 3 animal classes(Dog,Cat,Horse) create 3 methods in each class. create
3 fields and constructors as well in each class. Create the object of all 3 classes
and call 2 methods from each class. Yuo must use inheritance to avoid code duplication
Method Overriding:
    it's when a sub class has the exact same method as parent method but a different
    implementation.
What are the benefits of Method Overriding.
    1) Flexibility(if you don't like something from the parent class you can override it).
    2) Cleaner code
Rules:
    1) if we want to override a method in the child class return type,method name
    and parameters they must be same.
    2) private methods can't be overridden.
    3) We can't override constructors.
    4) static methods
