static keyword:
    static is a keyword that can be used with variables, methods,classes etc.
    when we use this keyword with a variable that variable becomes static variables.
    when we use it with methods those methods become static methods.
static variables:
    static variables can be accessed in all type of methods(instance,static). They
    can also be accessed in multiple objects of a class.
static methods:
    static methods  will have same behaviour across all the instances of a class because
    no instance fields are allowed inside the static methods.
Note:
    1) We can call the methods by just writing their name if we are in the same class.
    however if we are in a different class we need to write class before the method name
    if we want to call it.
Access Modifiers:
     Controls the access of entities like variables methods. There are 4 access levels
     in java. 1) private  2)default 3)protected 4)public. There are 3 keywords in java
     that can be used to apply these access levels.
private:
    It we write private keyword with any variable method constructor etc no one else
    outside of that class can access it.
default:
    All the entities with default access can be accessed within the same class as well as in any
    other class within the same package
protected:
    This will be discussed after inheritance.
public:
    if something is public all the classes in a project
    can access it.
How do we decide the access level
==========================================================
1)fields/properties/instance variables are almost always created as private.
2) methods 70 to 80% of the time are declared as public.
3) 98% to 99% classes are declared as public.
